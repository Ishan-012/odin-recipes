            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basmati Rice- </strong>Long-grain basmati rice is traditionally used to make biryani. I prefer the Kohinoor brand extra-long grain basmati rice, which is easily available at Indian grocery stores.</li>
                <li><strong>Chicken -</strong> Traditionally, whole bone-in chicken pieces are used to make biryani. Here in the US, it can be tough to find a whole chicken that's properly cut for biryani. As a handy shortcut, I like to use a mix of bone-in drumsticks and boneless chicken thighs. This way, you still get those authentic flavors and tender, juicy meat!</li>
                <li><strong>Whole Spices -</strong> shahi jeera, bay leaves, star anise, cloves, and green cardamom pods. A classic combination of spices to infuse the rice with rich flavor. </li>
                <li><strong>Ground Spices -</strong> turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder, Biryani Masala. Garam masala can be used in a pinch in place of Biryani Masala.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow Onion -</strong> thinly sliced yellow onion caramelized in ghee makes for the signature Birista onions that are a must in the marinade as well as for topping. With a rich golden color, they add a sweet, caramelized flavor to complement all the spices. Although these onions are traditionally deep-fried I also have an air fryer fried onions recipe.</li>
                <li><strong>Ghee -</strong> homemade ghee helps bring authentic taste and aromas to Biryani and I highly recommend using ghee instead of oil when making Biryani.</li>
                <li><strong>Herbs -</strong> fresh mint and cilantro add a perfect combination of herbs for cool, citrusy flavors and a pop of color.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the marinade by mixing yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, mint leaves, and lemon juice. Add chicken and coat evenly with the marinade. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan and add onions. On medium heat, fry the onions, stirring frequently, until they start to turn golden brown - about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium pot, heat water. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cloves, and salt to the rice and bring the to a boil on high heat. Add soaked and drained rice and bring to a full boil on high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook uncovered until the rice is about 90% cooked. Drain the rice promptly and reserve.</li>
                <li>To the pan with the remaining ghee, add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through. Gently layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Top with caramelized onions and saffron-infused milk. Cover the pot and seal it with aluminum foil, then place some weight on top of the lid. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and open the pot after 10 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve Biryani hot with lemon wedges and a cooling raita!</strong></li>
