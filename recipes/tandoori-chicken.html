    <p>Tandoori refers to a style of cooking in Indian cuisine where food is marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices and then cooked in a tandoor, which is a clay oven. The heat generated by burning charcoal or wood in the tandoor cooks the food at high temperatures, giving it a characteristic charred and smoky flavor. Tandoori dishes are often associated with vibrant red color due to the use of spices like paprika or red chili powder in the marinade.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken Wings -</strong> I recommend Bell Evan's brand wings that are already cut in half. If you have whole wings, make sure to cut them in half (wingettes and drumettes) and discard the tips.</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger and Garlic -</strong> fresh homemade ginger paste and garlic paste add a nice kick and flavor to the wings. Make sure the ginger and garlic paste is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Yogurt -</strong> plain full-fat yogurt or plain Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices -</strong> Kashmiri red chili powder, fenugreek leaves, homemade garam masala, turmeric, and salt</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice -</strong> helps tenderize the meat and helps with marination</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim as much fat and skin off the wings using kitchen shears.</li>
        <li>Add yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, Kashmiri red chili powder, fenugreek leaves, homemade garam masala, turmeric, lemon juice, and salt over the chicken wings. 
        </li>
        <li>Mix it well and refrigerate for at least an hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a perforated grilling tray on top of the baking tray (to collect all the drippings and make cleanup easy). Lightly grease the perforated tray and line the wings.</li>
        <li>Bake the wings for 20-25 minutes (in a convection oven) or up to 40 minutes otherwise. Broil on high for the last 2 minutes to get the char marks. Note: Wings can also be cooked on a preheated outdoor grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve hot with coriander-cumin spiced yogurt or tangy blue cheese and fresh lemon wedges.</strong></li>
    </ol>
